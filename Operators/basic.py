#operators

#arithmatic operator
# a and b are operands

a = 5
b = 2
# sum = a+b
print(a+b)
print(a-b)
print(a/b)
print(a*b)
print(a**b)
print(a//b)

#assignment operator
x = 5
# x = x+3
# print(x)

x*=3
print(x)

#comparison operator
x = 5
y = 7
print(x==y)
print(x>y)
print(x<=y)
print(x!=y)

#Logical Operators
A= x<y and y!=x
print(A)

B= x>y or y!=x
print(B)

print(not(x>y and y==x))

#concatination
x = "python"
y = " is"
z = " awsome"
print(x+y+z)
